# SensorLive: Predicting Brake Failures Using Sensor Data

**SensorLive** is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict brake system failures by analyzing sensor data. By identifying patterns in sensor readings, it helps reduce the need for costly physical inspections and provides early alerts for potential issues, which is crucial in mitigating Type II errors (false negatives). Undetected brake failures could lead to severe safety risks.

## Project Overview

The **SensorLive** pipeline is designed to handle the entire process of **ingesting**, **validating**, **transforming**, and **modeling** sensor data. The project focuses on:
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that each stage of the pipeline is well-documented and can be re-run with minimal effort.
- **Scalability**: Configurations are designed for handling large volumes of data.
- **Monitoring in Production**: Real-time monitoring and logging to track model performance and detect issues.

The project incorporates continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) configurations to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Source Extraction**: Connects to MongoDB to fetch real-time sensor data.
- **Data Loading**: Extracts, loads, and stores data for preprocessing.
- **Raw Data Handling**: Cleans the dataset by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant fields.

### 2. Data Validation
- **Schema Matching**: Ensures each sensor reading matches the expected schema (e.g., data types, field names).
- **Range Validation**: Checks if sensor readings are within valid ranges to detect anomalies.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identifies and removes duplicate entries that could skew analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags any unexpected or inconsistent data using predefined thresholds set in `config/validation_config.yaml`.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates additional features from raw sensor readings to improve predictive performance.
- **Scaling and Encoding**: Standardizes numerical data and encodes categorical features.
- **Data Splitting**: Divides the data into training and testing sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of faulty and non-faulty cases.

### 4. Model Training
- **Model Selection**: Tests algorithms suitable for time-series or sensor data (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses techniques like grid search or random search to tune model parameters, prioritizing recall to reduce false negatives (Type II errors).
- **Cross-Validation**: Validates the model across multiple data splits to ensure robustness and generalizability.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model in `saved_models/` for deployment.

### 5. Deployment (Model Pusher)
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the model for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automates deployment scripts in `.github/workflows` to push the model to production once validated.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Implements logging to track model inputs, outputs, and detect potential data drift over time.

### 6. Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests ensure each pipeline component works as expected.
- **CI/CD**: Using GitHub Actions, the pipeline automatically tests and deploys new changes when pushed to the repository.
- **Alerts**: Configured alerts for pipeline failures or anomalies detected during the process.
